# Transfer Learning-based Image Classification

This code is written to pretrain and fine-tune three well-known deep learning models for image classification. All the models are loaded from the torchvision library.

## Models Included
1. ResNet Model
2. VGG Model
3. Vision Transformer Model

## Getting Started

Before running the code, follow these steps:

1. Load `helper.py` and `dl_engine.py` from the git repository.
2. Run the Jupyter notebook (`main.ipynb`) cell by cell.
3. Make sure to select a GPU before running the code for optimal performance.

## Code Structure

- `helper.py`: Contains helper functions used in the project.
- `dl_engine.py`: Implements the deep learning engine for training and evaluation.
- `main.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the main code for the project.

## Requirements

- PyTorch
- torchvision
- GPU for accelerated training

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
