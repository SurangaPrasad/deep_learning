# Image Classification with Pretrained Deep Learning Models

This repository contains code for pretraining and fine-tuning three well-known deep learning models for image classification. The implemented models are loaded from the torchvision library:

1. **ResNet Model**
2. **VGG Model**
3. **Vision Transformer Model (ViT)**

Before running the code we have to load helper.py and dl_engine.py from the git repository. You can import these files by running the first code cell in the notebook.

Makesure to select a GPU before running the code
